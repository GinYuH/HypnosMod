# Hypnos Mod Update

A content and polish update focused on localization fixes, inter-mod compatibility, and a few new toys to play with.

## What’s New
- **Chinese Localization**
  - Filled in and corrected previously **missing Chinese localization entries** (Boss Checklist texts, Bestiary, Tooltips).

- **Fixes**
  - Fixed **Boss Checklist** integration (display omissions/inconsistencies are resolved).
  - Fixed a **music conflict** that could cause incorrect or overlapping tracks.

- **New Weapons Ported from CalRemix & Fandom Wiki**
  - **Planetarium** 
  - **Neuraze** 
  - **Aergian Technistaff** 

- **Loot**
  - **Hypnos**: updated **loot drops** to drop the upmentioned weapons.

## Credits
- Shamelessly yoinked generous chunks of pristine code from **GinYuH** (via **CalRemix** and **HypnosMod**) — thanks for the wizardry!
- Calamity Fandom Wiki's genius ideas.

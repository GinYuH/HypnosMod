It’s the one and only XP-00 Hypnos! 100% faithfully recreates from his page on the officially unofficial Fandom Calamity Mod Wiki!!! 

The mod contains:
[olist]
[*] The one and only XP-00 Hypnos and his legion of 12 trusty Aergia Neurons (That's a lot!)
[*] A mask that lets you yield some of Hypnos’ handsome looks (Wow!)
[*] A trophy that will let Hypnos be in your home at all times (24/7 Surveillance!!)
[*] A wide array of 0 weapons. (                )
[/olist]

To summon XP-00 Hypnos just simply right click the Bloody Vein pet item on The Codebreaker, and the real Draedon will come down to summon the Hypnos machine, instead of the unpreferable and lesser Ares, Artemis, Thanatos, or Apollo.

Disclaimers:
[olist]
[*] Hypnos may not multiplay well.
[*] The weapons haven’t been made yet, but are planned.
[*] This is a word for word recreation of the Wiki page, including all of its horrible design flaws. Any unfair attacks won’t be fixed unless the XP-00 Hypnos article is modified by Team Hypnos/AmmyanDocCiesh.
